	"Aw dang, why did the beach have to close today!" A young crafter named Jody groaned as he and his two friends stared rather glumly at the barred gates. The trio had looked forward to spending the day at the beach surfing, but, as it was, they had to go back home.
	
	"It sucks," Kariis agreed. "C'mon, let's head back to my jeep. We'll eat icecream and rootbeer instead."
	
	Jody looked ruefully at his surfboard as he and his friends walked back to Kariis's jeep. "I was looking forward to surfing on those cold waves."
	
	"We all were, " Vrek said. "Right now I want to get out of this of the bloody sun."
	
	Kariis got into his keep and revved it up. "C'mon guys, let's go."
	
	Vrek and Jody had paused and stared at something at the sky. Kariis sighed in frustration and honked his horn. Vrek broke his gaze. "Kariis, there's something coming from the sky-Get outta the truck!"
	
	A large meteorite came falling from the heavens as Kariis jumped out of car. Seconds later, the large mass of rock, dust and ice and hit the earth causing a concussive blast that moved cars, felled people and shattered windows within 50 meters of the area.
