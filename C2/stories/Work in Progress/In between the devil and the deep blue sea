A young captain of the Atbarian company stood on a crest of a hill, carefully surveying the wooded mountain in front of her. "What do you think, Alyn?"

"I say, " Alyn, her bodygaurd, began, "that although I'm blind, there seems to be an obstacle in our path."

"You're not that blind, " the officer said with a little laugh, "You can see foggy shapes."

"And that's considered 'not-blind', Lys?" Alyn asked. "I still consider that being blind. I use my sharp sense of hearing to make my way around and attack."

"But I thought you couldn't see the blades flying towards you," Lys said, drawing her spatha out of her sheath and examining it.

"I can't most of the time," Alyn admitted. "Usually I can hear the sound of the swing and ususally I can dodge or block accordingly."

"Or get cut," Lys said with a smirk. "C'mon, " she said , sheathing her sword. "We've got to reach the capitol before the meeting."

Alyn nodded. "Riiiight, and why are we going to this meeting?"

"It's a meeting for all officers to congregate talk about plans for the future war."

"All officers, huh?" Alyn mused. "Are bodyguards allowed?" he asked.

"No, sorry," Lys said apologetically. "Only officers."

Alyn shrugged. "Makes no difference to me. Dosen't take much to get what I want." 

"Captain!"

Lys turned to see a girl running up. "What is it Kath?"

Kath bit her lip in consternation. "There are enemy soilders, Furnin soilders, heading here right now! We have to go!"

Alyn sighed. "Since when were you afraid of soilders, Kath?"

Kath glared at him. "There are 3 platoons under Jonah Dower."

Alyn blinked. "Oh. Him."

A young man with strnge blue hair ran up. "Captain, there are 2 platoons of elite soilders coming up the path from the south. Furnin soilders."

Lys bit her tongue to hold the curse that was ready to fly out. "From which direction is the other platoon coming from, Kath?"

"East, captain."

Lys screwed up her nose and thought. She gave a groan of disgust. "We could crush one of the grous, but we only have 6 soilders. Lightly armed."

"I'm the only heavy-armed guy, " the new-comer said with a scratch of his head.

"We'll have to make a run for it. Ugh, I wish we didn't have to do this," Lys said.

"Your orders, Captain," Alyn said calmly, leaning on his long sword.

"We cross over that little mountain. Resistance is useless for now. If they do catch us, we can fight them better in the woods. Lieutenant Gram, give the orders."

"Yes, Captain." The young man with the blue hair ran off.

"Do you think running like this is a wise choice?" Kath asked anxiously. "What if there is a trap?"

"There is nothing I can do if there is one. it's either inevitable death or a trap," Lys explained. "I have a feeling they will be waiting for us at the bottom of the hill."

Within 15 minutes, the small scouting party of 10 fled up the mountain. General Jonah Dower smiled in satisfaction. "They've gone up the mountain. We'll just leave the rest to those worthless thugs of Gonk."

Back up at the mountain-side, Kath leaned against a boulder and let out a laboured wheez. "Gosh, if I knew climbing hills were this hard, I-'d have stayed home."

Gram shrugged. "Live with it. I'm so much more laden than you are, an' I ain't complaining."

Kath sighed and turned to Alyn who was helping Lys up the moutain. "Could you help me up, too?"

Alyn nodded, "Sure, take my hand." He helped her climb up the steep terrain and clambered up afterwards. "I-I think we're at the top."

Lys suddenly dropped to her knees and began gasping. Alarmed, Alyn, Kath and Gram ran over. "High Altitude Air sickness," Alyn said kneeling next to his Captain. "Just breath slowly and deeply captain, take it easy." 

After a little bit of care, Lys was back to normal with just a small headache. "Sorry, " she mumbled, "I forgot I had High altitude air sickness. I'm all right now."

"Are you sure?" Kath asked, concern in her voice. "We can always take a rest."

"Yes, a rest would be good indeed," said a deep, guttural nasty voice.
